# T.I.N.U
I have designed an AI based App for the healthcare industry mainly focusing on helping paralyzed people
My project is called TINU an acronym for Technological Insight for Neurological Upliftment.I want to use AI to create a predictive model that anticipates the evolving needs of this people And provides us with the best Rehabilitation programs and keeps a live track of the person's vitals. The app would take live inputs from devices such as an ECG machine, Pulse oximeter and blood pressure cuff. And feeds this data to an AI which can alert us if it sees any anomly in those readings. These Devices would be the same as the smart watch on your wrist recording your heart rate small compact and easy to carry around.
The Approach to this solution is quiet simple
We first have to understand what an individual needs and then collect the data accordingly to make a viable health monitoring system and deduce the best rehabilitation tasks an individual can do according to his current state of health.
As the AI collects more data on an individual it learns and improves further enabling it to perform much efficiently.
